## About this project

**CS50 Finance** is a web app build with **Flask** via which users can "buy" and "sell" stocks. The data utilized in the project is provided by [IEX](https://iexcloud.io/), which lets us download stock quotes via their API.

This project is one of the ten problem sets from CS50, Harvard University's introduction to computer science.
